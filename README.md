# wlp4-tools
A collection of silly wlp4 tools based on University of Waterloo's Foundations of Sequential Programs (CS241) second-year CS course.

These are a collection of silly wlp4 tools inspired by various jokes amongst my friends and various members of the [Programming Languages Group](http://plg.uwaterloo.ca) at the University of Waterloo, started while I was TAing [CS241](http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/).

WLP4 is CS241's toy C-like language, which is based upon a toy MIPS32-based assembly language which is about as minimalistic as possible while still being Turing-complete. This repository is intended for various tools which compile WLP4 code, assemble the resulting assembly, run a virtual machine or otherwise, with an emphasis on esoteric languages or solutions to problems.
